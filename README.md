# 🛒 Smart Substitutions 2.0 for Blinkit
**Case Study: Personalized Auto-Replacements for Quick-Commerce**

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Blinkit and other quick-commerce apps face **out-of-stock (OOS)** issues.  
Current replacements are **generic** and often irrelevant to user preferences (e.g., dietary needs, brand loyalty).  

This results in:  
- Low substitution acceptance  
- Cart abandonment 🚫  
- Decline in customer trust 😕

## 👤 User Persona

**Ankit, 30, Tech Professional**  
- Weekly grocery shopper on Blinkit  
- Loyal to toned/skimmed milk  
- Frustrated when Blinkit replaces with full-cream milk  
- Wants personalized substitutions based on **his past purchases**  

---

## 🗺️ Current Flow (Issue)

1. User adds preferred item to cart  
2. Item goes OOS at checkout  
3. Blinkit suggests random replacement (e.g., Amul Gold Full Cream)  
4. User rejects → Cart abandoned

## 💡 Proposed Solution: Smart Substitutions 2.0

### Features
